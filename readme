This project is written by Yichao Sun. The project is just a side project to prepare for get a job. 
It has no commercial purpose. However, no one shall be reproduced without my permission.

Current progress:
The basic mechanics of the game are almost complete, just lack of mechanisms for the entourage to attack each other and display entourage information (in progress)

Then I will do:
1 Implement all basic card functions in the game
2 Later on in the classic packages and in each extension package, I would pick 30 CARDS from each package that I thought would be difficult to implement.

If it is necessary to continue updating this project for some reason or I have more time. I will keep this project updated
